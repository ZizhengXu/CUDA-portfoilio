# Dustmap interpolation project

To create continuous 2D cosmic dust maps from discrete, scattered observations, we tested a bunch of methods, including our proposed new mathematical method (inverse Lanczos interpolation). The repository contains the code needed to recreate the figures and results presented in this [paper](https://github.com/ZizhengXu/my_portfoilio/blob/master/Dustmap-interpolation-project-master/Reconstructing_2D_Cosmic_Dust_Maps.pdf).

This project was completed with the help of Dr. Douglas Finkbeiner, Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Harvard University, with collaborators Stephen Slater and Kenneth Chen.

Further explorations of alternative methods lead us to the triangle-based C1 interpolation method, as demonstrated in the [C1Interpolator.ipynb](https://github.com/ZizhengXu/Dustmap-interpolation-project/blob/master/C1Interpolator.ipynb).
